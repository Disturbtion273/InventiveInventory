# Inventive Inventory [BETA]

A brand new, completely client-side and lightweight inventory management mod.  
Enjoy features like sorting, locking slots, loading profiles and automatic refilling.  
Stay tuned for further updates!  
[Support will be maintained long-term]

## Features ðŸš€ðŸ’¡
### Sorting ðŸ”€ðŸ” 
There's a mess in your inventory? No problem, a simple key press will it get organized.
Furthermore, the sorting function is aware of the cursorâ€™s position. This means that if youâ€™re in a container and hover over your inventory, the inventory will be sorted instead of the container. In all other scenarios, the container will be sorted.
> This feature is compatible with all types of containers.

**[Currently under development]**

### Locked Slots ðŸ”’ðŸš«
You can lock slots in your inventory by holding the Advanced Operation Key (Default: Alt) and clicking on the slot. Items in such a slot will not be affected by sorting.

### Profiles ðŸ“‹ðŸ“‚
Save your current hotbar, armor and offhand state and load it anytime back to the saved state.

<summary>Commands</summary>

- Save: **/inventive-profile save <profile_name> [optional_keybinding]**
- Load: **/inventive-profile load <profile_name>**
- Delete: **/inventive-profile delete <profile_name>**

> When you use the save command, you have to add a custom name. This custom name will be displayed each time the profile is loaded and also in the keybind settings. Additionally, you can assign a keybind to the profile. This keybind will be linked to the profile, allowing you to quickly access it. However, this is only possible if the chosen key is one of the Profile Keys. These keys are suggested by default but can be modified in the settings.

- Default Loading: **<Alt>** + **<Number [1-9]>**

## Known Bugs ðŸª²
### Sorting
1. Sometimes, weird stuff can happen when trying to sort items in Creative mode. As our primary focus is on enhancing the Survival experience, we plan to investigate and address these issues in the future. In the meantime, we recommend not using this mod in Creative mode. Please note that the mod currently doesnâ€™t work well on server networks like Hypixel, but it should function normally on other hosted servers.
