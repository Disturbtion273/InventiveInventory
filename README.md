# Inventive Inventory [BETA]

A brand new, completely client-side and lightweight inventory management mod. Enjoy features like sorting, locking slots, loading profiles and automatic refilling. Stay tuned for further updates!<br>
[Support will be maintained long-term]

## Features
### Sorting
There's a mess in your inventory? No problem, just hit the key and sort it. Works in every type of container as well. Additionally the sorting is cursor-position-aware. Therefore when in a container and hovering over your inventory, it will get sorted instead of the container. In any other case the container gets sorted. <br>
**[Currently under development]**

### Locked Slots
You can lock slots in your inventory by holding the Advanced Operation Key (Default: ALT) and clicking on the slot. Items in such a slot will not be affected by sorting. <br>
**[Currently under development]**

### Profiles
Save your current hotbar, armor and offhand state and load it anytime back to the saved state. <br>
Save by typing: **/inventiveprofile save <profile_name>** <br>
Load by typing: **/inventiveprofile load <profile_name>** <br>
(Hotkey support will be added soon) <br>
**[Currently under development]**

### Automatic Refilling

## Known Bugs
### Sorting
1. In creative happens weird stuff sometimes when trying to sort. Since we focus more on the survival experience this will be looked into sometime in the future. Until then we recommend to not use this mod in creative. Furthermore it currently does not work on server networks like Hypixel. Normal hosted servers shouldn't be a problem though.
